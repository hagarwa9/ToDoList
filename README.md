# ToDoList
This is a project for creating a to-do list for daily activity.
**Features include:**
1) Serves up an HTML, CSS and JS page to the browser.
2) Input box on the page that allows the user to enter a string. When a string is entered it is then added to the list.
4) Clicking on an item in the list marks it complete and moves it to the bottom of the list.
5) Clicking on the x of an item removes the item from the list.
6) Filter buttons that: 
   shows completed items only; 
   shows to do items only; and 
   shows all items.
7) Sort functionality that sorts the list by earliest to latest entry, and in reverse.
